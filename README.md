We see that in total there will be 90,398 positions that will need to be filled after the “silver tsunami”. According to the Mentorship Eligibility table, there are 1,549 available. There are enough employees to mentor but they would be in charge of large groups of trainees. There are not enough mentors for a one to one mentorship ratio as would be requested. It would be beneficial to create a query that can tell us about the salaries of those employees that are eligible for retirement to understand an idea of the budget for hiring and filling those previously held positions. We can create a query as shown below:

We would then have the following table as output:

They could use these tables and queries to help them better prepare for potential staffing issues that they will inevitably face in the coming years at Pewlett-Hackard. Having this information will be pivotal to keeping the company running smoothly and not having gaps in valuable positions.
